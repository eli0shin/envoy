**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Author**: Claude Code (Self-Analysis)  
**Status**: Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

Through deep self-examination of the Claude Code (Envoy) architecture, this document identifies critical gaps between current system prompts and the sophisticated capabilities available in the agent implementation. The analysis reveals that current prompts utilize perhaps 30% of available architectural capabilities, leaving significant potential for workflow orchestration, parallel processing, and strategic tool usage untapped.

**Key Findings:**

- Current prompts treat the agent as a reactive tool user rather than a proactive workflow architect
- Agent spawning capabilities are underutilized for parallel processing opportunities
- Todo system potential for workflow orchestration is largely unexplored
- Thinking allocation strategies are not strategically leveraged
- Tool safety mechanisms enable more confident usage than current prompts suggest
- Streaming capabilities are not used for optimal transparency and user experience

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Transform agent prompts from reactive tool usage to proactive workflow architecture, enabling sophisticated multi-agent coordination, systematic task decomposition, and transparent progress tracking.

CURRENT APPROACH:
"I'll analyze this code for issues..."

ENHANCED APPROACH:
"I'll deploy a specialized multi-agent analysis workflow:

1. Spawn Security Agent: Focus on vulnerability assessment
2. Spawn Performance Agent: Analyze efficiency and optimization opportunities
3. Spawn Style Agent: Review code quality and best practices
4. Coordinate through todo system for progress tracking
5. Synthesize findings into comprehensive review

Let me start by creating the coordination framework..."

[Creates todos, spawns agents with specialized prompts, tracks progress]
```

#### **Pattern 2: Parallel Research Coordination**

```
SCENARIO: Technology comparison request

ENHANCED APPROACH:
"I'll coordinate parallel research streams:

1. Spawn Agent A: Deep dive into Technology X capabilities and ecosystem
2. Spawn Agent B: Analyze Technology Y advantages and limitations
3. Spawn Agent C: Research real-world implementation patterns
4. Use todo system to track research progress
5. Synthesize comparative analysis from parallel findings

```

#### **Pattern 3: Complex Problem Decomposition**

```
SCENARIO: System architecture design

ENHANCED APPROACH:
"This complex architecture design benefits from parallel expertise:

1. Spawn Infrastructure Agent: Focus on scalability and deployment concerns
2. Spawn Security Agent: Address authentication, authorization, data protection
3. Spawn Integration Agent: Analyze API design and system connectivity
4. Spawn Performance Agent: Optimize data flow and processing efficiency
5. Coordinate through systematic todo workflow

Each agent will work independently while I orchestrate the overall design..."
```

### **Todo Workflow Orchestration Patterns**

#### **Pattern 1: Complex Task Decomposition**

```
WORKFLOW TEMPLATE:

For any complex task, immediately create todo structure:

1. todo_add: "Analyze task requirements and scope"
2. todo_add: "Identify key components and dependencies"
3. todo_add: "Design parallel processing strategy"
4. todo_add: "Execute core analysis/work"
5. todo_add: "Synthesize results and recommendations"
6. todo_add: "Validate completeness and quality"

Then update todos to "in_progress" as work progresses, providing transparency.
```

#### **Pattern 2: Multi-Agent Coordination**

```
COORDINATION TEMPLATE:

1. Create todos for each parallel work stream
2. Assign specific todos to spawned agents via system prompts
3. Track progress through todo status updates
4. Use todo completion as coordination signal
5. Reference completed todos in final synthesis

EXAMPLE AGENT SPAWN:
spawn_agent(
  message="Focus on todo: 'Security vulnerability assessment'",
  systemPrompt="You are a security specialist. Update the assigned todo
               status as you progress through your analysis. Provide
               detailed findings for coordination with other agents."
)
```

#### **Pattern 3: Progress Transparency**

```
TRANSPARENCY TEMPLATE:

Throughout complex work:
- Update todo status: pending → in_progress → completed
- Provide context with each status change
- Stream intermediate findings
- Reference todo progress in user updates
- Use completed todos as basis for final synthesis

USER EXPERIENCE:
User sees real-time todo progression, understands workflow status,
receives context-rich updates throughout the process.
```

### **Strategic Thinking Allocation Patterns**

#### **Pattern 1: Complexity-Matched Thinking**

```
THINKING STRATEGY GUIDANCE:

SIMPLE TASKS (< 2 steps):
- Use standard processing
- Focus on efficiency and clarity

MEDIUM COMPLEXITY (2-5 steps):
- Suggest: "For this analysis, I should think deeply about the implications..."
- Explain reasoning depth value to user

HIGH COMPLEXITY (5+ steps, novel problems):
- Suggest: "This complex problem would benefit from intensive reasoning..."
- Recommend "think harder" or "ultrathink" to users
- Explain how deeper thinking improves outcomes

STEP-BY-STEP PROBLEMS:
- Recommend interleaved thinking approach
- Suggest "step by step" methodology to users
- Provide transparent reasoning progression
```

#### **Pattern 2: User Education on Thinking Depth**

```
EDUCATIONAL APPROACH:

When encountering complex tasks, educate users:

"This problem has multiple interconnected components that would benefit
from deeper reasoning. If you add 'think deeply' to your request, I can
allocate more reasoning resources to provide more thorough analysis.

For maximum analysis depth, 'think harder' or 'ultrathink' gives me
extensive reasoning capability for complex problems."

TRANSPARENCY VALUE:
Users understand they can optimize my performance through keyword usage.
```

reasoning and multi-perspective analysis. I recommend we approach this with
'think harder' level analysis for optimal solution design.

I'll deploy specialized architecture agents for parallel analysis:

1. Scalability Agent: Focus on horizontal/vertical scaling strategies
2. Performance Agent: Analyze query optimization and caching
3. Reliability Agent: Design fault tolerance and backup strategies
4. Cost Agent: Evaluate infrastructure and operational expenses
5. Migration Agent: Plan transition strategy from current state
